# History

geni-soil was originally available as AMsoil at
https://github.com/fp7-ofelia/AMsoil.git. That repository was removed
due to copyright issues with AMS Oil (http://www.amsoil.com). A
descendent of that original repository is available at
https://github.com/EICT/eiSoil but that repository has a new commit
history.

This repository is a descendent of the original AMsoil repository. It
has been customized for the
[GENI Clearinghouse](https://github.com/GENI-NSF/geni-ch) in a few
small ways.

# Purpose

AMsoil is a light-weight framework for creating Aggregate Managers (AM) for test beds.
AMsoil is a pluggable system. It gives structure to develop new AMs and provides helpers for common tasks in AM development.

AMsoil is part of the [OFELIA](http://www.fp7-ofelia.eu/) [Control Framework (OCF)](https://github.com/fp7-ofelia).

If you don't know what an Aggregate Manager is please see [here](https://alpha.fp7-ofelia.eu/doc/index.php/General_terminology).
